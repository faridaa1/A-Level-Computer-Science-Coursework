Hospital Database

This repository contains my A Level Computer Science Coursework - a project that focuses on the development of a database for storing the details of hospital patients. The database is comprised of a series of inputs which consist of basic details about patients, such as their name, age, and NHS ID. Furthermore, a graph is implemented since visualisation enables easy data analysis. This will enable the quick identification of pattens and trends.

This project needs to be undertaken in order for hospitals to keep a record of their patients, so when a doctor meets a patient, they are aware of their history and what they need to be treated with. A database makes it easy to access patient records and enables administration to operate effectively. Moreover, the database may be seen as a more secure way to store information, as paper records may result in vital information being lost easily through water/ink damage, ripping, with no form of backup or retrieval.

The project is coded in Python, with Tkinter user to provide a user interface.
